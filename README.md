# Moein Mehrani - Personal Portfolio Website

![Portfolio Preview](portfolio-thumbnail.png)
## Overview

This is the personal portfolio website of Moein Mehrani, a passionate UI/UX & Product Designer, WordPress Expert, and AI-Enhanced Developer. This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects in a dynamic, interactive, and modern single-page application (SPA) format.

The website is built entirely with vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, emphasizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and a custom client-side router for seamless page transitions without full reloads, mimicking a Virtual DOM behavior.

The design features a distinctive "hacker/matrix" theme, reflecting my interest in technology and cutting-edge development practices.
